# Nook

It gets my notes from notion and highlights accross the web, presents them grouped by tags, concepts, topics and subjects, enabling me select a tag or group of tags and swiping through the cards containing concise points i must not forget.

It sets events in my calender for recall time, when the concepts i just learnt are presented, and i can read through them and answer questions to that test my understanding of the points.

Currently we can get notes from notion and show them in a list. As long as the notion doc is properly 
formatted we're good.
Always remember to format you notion docs properly!
- It stops at 100 elements and provides a cursor to pick up the rest. Need to add this functinality to load more when we reach the end of the list. Like infinite scroll.
- Also for performance, add windowing/virtualization.
- Get the topics and load the notes for that topic.
- Fix all types.
