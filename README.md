# Nook

It gets my notes from notion and highlights across the web (browser extension), presents them grouped by tags - concepts, topics and subjects, enabling me select a tag or group of tags and swiping through the cards containing concise points i must not forget.

Its the home for my notes on topics like dependency injection, Data structures, Algos. 

It sets events in my calendar for recall time, when the concepts i just learnt are presented for me to read through and answer questions to that test my understanding of the points and jog my memory.

Currently we can get notes from notion and show them in a list. As long as the notion doc is properly formatted we're good.
*Always remember to format you notion docs properly!*
